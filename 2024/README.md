This repository collects all the information and material that we developed to teach and support the "Laboratorio di Genomica Comparata" course at the university of Bologna for the academic year 2024-2025. A brief excursus about what is present in this folder is:

- 00_Bash: Here are listed ALL the commands that we will use, their explanations, and some examples of their use. This is more ment to be used as a compendium of how to talk with our computer and obviously nobody expects you to know them by heart.
- 01_FastaFastq: SPOSTARE TUTTO QUESTO IN 03
- 02_ComputerEnv_ProjectWorkflow: This folders includes how are named and organised the environments in our machine and some information about our study system _Anopheles stephensii_.
- 03_KmerBased_GenomeSurvey: _a good start is half of the battle_. Working with good quality input is essential to obtain good quality results. Here we present the fastq format and how to assess the quality of sequencer outputs.
- 04_GenomeAssembly: this folder includes the descriptions of how to assembly our genome. We have contig level assembly, genome polishing, and genome evaluation to know how good we perfomred the first three passages. In the end contaminants detection and reference-based scaffolding.
- 05_GenomeAssembly2: UNIRE ASSEMBLY 1 E 2
- 06_Genome Annotation: Here we perform the genome annotation of our brand new _Anopheles stephensii_ genome, discovering its features.
- 07_OG.Inference_Phylogenomic: Here we perform orthology inference and then use computed orthgroups to infer our species tree.
- 08_DivergenceTime_Estimation: Using all the information we gathered so far, we estimate the divergence time between our species of interest.
- 09_GeneFamilies_Evolution: genes evolve in several ways. Duplication and deletaion of gene---expanding or contracting---gene familties is only one way. Using CAFE we can delve in it.
- 10_GeneAnnotation: This folder includes explanation and tips on how to annotate genes in our genome (personally my favorite part). This functional part may be wide, but it is meant to be so in order to allow everyone's creativy to thrive. We will use GOterms, codeml to search for any sign of selection in our genes of interest, and KEGG database to understand how everything is connected.
