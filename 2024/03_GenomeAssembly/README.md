# Genome Assembly

In this chapter we finally start assemblying our genome.

- [Genome_assembly1](./genome_assembly1.md): Here are all the steps required to assemble our genome, starting with the contig level, then the scaffolding, and the gap filling. We will end with our first genome evaluation.
- [Genome_assembly_2](./Genome_assembly_2.md): This second part contains a couple of steps that will be only partially individually computed: the contamination detection and the reference based scaffolding.
