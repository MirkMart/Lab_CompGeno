# Laboratorio di Genomica Comparata (Comparative Genomics Laboratory)

**Welcome!**

This repository collects all the information and materials that we developed to teach and support the "Laboratorio di Genomica Comparata" course at the university of Bologna. The repository is split into different folder based on the academic year of teaching.

Before we start, here are a few key definitions to keep in mind:

- Terminal: a program or interface you use to access the shell.
- Shell: a command-line interface (CLI) program that interprets commands and communicates them to the operating system.
- Bash: a popular shell and scripting language used in Unix-like environments.
- Unix: a family of operating systems, including Linux and macOS.

We highly recommend the book [Bioinformatics Data Skills](https://womengovtcollegevisakha.ac.in/departments/Bioinformatics%20Data%20Skills%20Reproducible%20and%20Robust%20Research%20with%20Open%20Source%20Tools%20by%20Vince%20Buffalo.pdf) by Vince Buffalo for anyone starting or advancing in bioinformatics. It's packed with practical advice, tips, and best practices. The first chapter and the opening paragraph of the third chapter are especially usefult introductions (we **highly** recommend everyone to read them).

As you might expect, the only real prerequisite here is being able to "communicate" with your operating system via the command line. Linux and macOS users don't need to worryâ€”your computers already come equipped with everything necessary. Windows users, however, will need to install a Unix shell emulator. Many options are available, but we personally recommend [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/), which lets you opne terminal anywhere by simpluy right-clicking and selecting "Open git bash here".
