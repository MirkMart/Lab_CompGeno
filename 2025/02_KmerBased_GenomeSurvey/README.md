# Kmer - Based Genome Survey

The first chapter of our laboratory is split into two parts:

- [FASTQ](./FASTQ.md): contains a brief introduction on the fasta and fastq format and on the two commonly used annotation files GFF and BED.
- [Kmer_survey](./Kmer_survey.md): Here we will define what a k-mer is and how k-mers can be used to estimate some genome characteristics.
